## Instructions

Welcome to the Feed Reader Testing Project! The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the value of testing. For this project, the testing framework [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) is used to write a number of tests against a pre-existing web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

To get started, open `index.html` and the Feed Reader should appear in the web browser. Scroll down to the bottom of the Feed Reader page. The Jasmine framework output will display all 7 test specs as passing, with 0 failures.

View the details of the testing development for this project by opening the `feedreader.js` file, which can be found in the spec folder of the Jasmine folder. In `feedreader.js`, there is Udacity starter code along with the updated tests and test suites that have been added by Minette Roberson. All tests and test suites added by Minette are indicated with a 'TODO' comment in the file. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Purpose

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.


## Requirements

To run the web-application, a web browser is required. A text editor is needed to view the details of the test suites. 


## Contributing

This repository contains a combination of starter code from Udacity and test code written by Minette J. Roberson. Because this Feed Reader is the product of a GWG Udacity FEND Project,  pull requests will most likely not be accepted until further notice.

In particular, the Udacity Knowledge Tool and Matthew Cranford's blog were excellent resources for learning how to approach this project.
